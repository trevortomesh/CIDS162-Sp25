Here’s the updated version of the README.md for CIDS 162, styled similarly to the previous ones for consistency:

# **CIDS 162 Repository**

Welcome to the repository for **CIDS 162: Intermediate Programming**! This repository contains the living textbook, all example code, lecture notes, assignments, and other resources for the Spring 2025 semester. The purpose of this course is to build upon the fundamentals of programming learned in **CIDS 161: Introduction to Computing** and translate those skills to **Java**, a more traditional and widely used programming language.

## **🎯 Course Objectives**
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Transition their Python programming skills to Java.
2. Define and utilize key object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
3. Solve computational problems using efficient programming techniques.
4. Implement structured, modular, and scalable Java programs.
5. Debug and document programs using industry-standard tools and practices.

---

## **🚀 Getting Started**
### **Software Requirements**
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** [Download the latest version](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA:** A free, student-friendly IDE for Java development. [Download it here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

### **Suggested Background**
This course assumes you have taken **CIDS 161** or have equivalent introductory programming experience in Python. You should be familiar with:
- Variables, loops, and conditionals.
- Functions and basic file input/output (I/O).
- Basic debugging techniques.

If you're new to programming or feel underprepared, let your instructor know for extra resources and support.

## **📅 Schedule**
Key dates for the semester:
- **Assignments:** 3 total (released every few weeks, with 2 weeks to complete each).
- **Quizzes:** 5 total (multiple-choice, based on lectures, 15-minute time limit).
- **Midterm Exam:** March 26, 2025 (in-person).
- **Final Exam:** May 14, 2025 (online).

Assignments and quizzes will be posted and submitted via Canvas. Refer to the course syllabus for detailed timelines.

## **🤝 Contributions**
This living textbook is meant to evolve throughout the semester. Contributions are welcome and encouraged! Here’s how you can help:
- Fix typos or suggest clearer explanations in the lecture notes.
- Add additional code examples or helpful references.
- Provide feedback on assignments, quizzes, or other materials.

If you have suggestions, submit an issue or pull request—or speak with the instructor during office hours.

---

## **📌 Notes on Academic Integrity**
This course encourages the use of tools like ChatGPT and other LLMs for learning and debugging. However:
1. You **must** clearly document any use of such tools in your assignments.
2. All work must represent your understanding of the material. Assignments that rely solely on LLM-generated content will receive a zero.
3. Always refer to the syllabus and [LLM Guide](#) for detailed policies.
