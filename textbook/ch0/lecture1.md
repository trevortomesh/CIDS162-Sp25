## **Welcome to CIDS 162**
Welcome to **CIDS 162: Intermediate Programming**! In this course, we’ll build on the foundations you developed in CIDS 161. While Python is a great language to start with, this class transitions to **Java**, a more traditional and structured programming language. Java introduces new challenges and opens up opportunities to learn concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), which are essential for many professional programming environments.

If you’re feeling hesitant about transitioning from Python to Java, don’t worry. This course will take what you already know and guide you step by step.

## **Course Objectives**
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Define and describe basic concepts of programming analysis and design.
- Implement and debug software applications.
- Explain the basic components of a programming language.
- Implement software using Java’s fundamental programming elements.
- Solve problems computationally and with structured design.

## **Why Java?**
While Python is great for beginners, Java:
- Is a **statically-typed** language, helping you catch errors earlier.
- Encourages structured programming with concepts like **classes**, **interfaces**, and **inheritance**.
- Is widely used in the industry for software development, Android development, and enterprise applications.
- Teaches you skills that transfer easily to other languages like C#, C++, and Kotlin.

Java’s syntax might feel more complex than Python’s at first, but it provides a deeper understanding of how programming languages work closer to the machine level.

## **What to Expect**
- **Recap and Transition**: The first few weeks will focus on translating your knowledge from Python to Java.
- **Live Coding**: We’ll do a lot of live coding in class. You’ll see me write, debug, and adapt code in real time, and you’ll be encouraged to follow along.
- **Hands-On Projects**: This course includes three major programming assignments. They’ll challenge you to apply the concepts we learn in class to real-world problems.
- **Quizzes and Exams**: There will be five quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam. Don’t worry—these will focus on reinforcing what we’ve covered in lectures.

## **How This Course is Structured**
- **Assignments**: Three large projects that involve applying Java programming concepts. Each assignment will be open for two weeks.
- **Quizzes**: Five quizzes spread throughout the semester. Each quiz will be 10 questions, multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank, and open for one week. Once started, you’ll have 15 minutes to complete it.
- **Midterm**: An in-person, multiple-choice exam focusing on content from quizzes.
- **Final Exam**: An online, comprehensive exam similar in format to the midterm and quizzes.

## **Important Notes**
- **Class Code Repository**: All code examples from lectures will be uploaded to the [class code repository](../../code).
- **Living Textbook**: This repository will also include a "living textbook" with lecture notes, examples, and additional resources.
- **IDE**: We’ll be using **JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA** for Java programming. This free, student-friendly IDE will help standardize our learning environment. If you prefer another tool like VS Code or Eclipse, you’re welcome to use it, but I won’t be troubleshooting anything other than IntelliJ.

## **Think About This**
1. **Why Programming Paradigms?**  
   Python and Java belong to different programming paradigms (dynamic vs. static typing). Why do you think programmers need to learn different paradigms instead of sticking to one?

2. **Error Detection**  
   Java emphasizes catching errors early through its syntax and type checks. How do you think this differs from the way Python handles errors? Which approach might be better for large-scale software?

3. **Learning Beyond Syntax**  
   Most programming languages share similar core concepts (like loops and conditionals). Why do you think learning a new language like Java can still be difficult even if you already know Python?

## **Closing Remarks**
Java might feel challenging at first, but mastering it will give you tools and confidence to tackle more complex programming projects. Take your time, ask questions, and don’t hesitate to reach out for help if you feel stuck.

Looking forward to seeing you on Wednesday as we start diving into Java programming basics!
