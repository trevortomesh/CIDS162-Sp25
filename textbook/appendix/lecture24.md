**CS 162 - Midterm Exam Review (March 31, 2025)**

**Exam Overview:**
- **Date:** Wednesday, April 2, 2025
- **Format:** Paper-based, in-person exam
- **Length:** 30 multiple-choice questions
- **Duration:** 50 minutes
- **Tools Allowed:** Pencils only (no notes, no computers, no phones)
- **Grading:** Scantron sheet (bubble letters)

**Exam Content:**
- All questions are based on Quizzes 1 and 2
- Questions will be similar to, but not necessarily identical to, those on the quizzes
- Instructor has reviewed and tested the exam for clarity

**Logistics:**
- Sit spaced apart to reduce distractions and ensure fairness
- Bring your own pencil (mechanical pencils are allowed; pens are not)
- Golf pencils will be provided if needed

**Review Summary (Key Points):**

1. **Data Types in Java**
    - Valid: `int`, `double`, `boolean`
    - Invalid: `imaginary` (not a Java data type)

2. **Switch Statements**
    - Missing `break` statements result in fall-through behavior (e.g., printing multiple cases)
    - Always add a `break` unless intentional fall-through is desired

3. **Syntax Errors**
    - Variables must be declared with a type (`int x = 10;`)
    - All open brackets must have matching closing brackets

4. **Comments in Java**
    - Single-line: `// comment`
    - Multi-line: `/* comment */`
    - `#` is used for comments in Python, **not** Java

5. **Compilation vs. Interpretation**
    - Java is a **compiled** language
    - Python is an **interpreted** language
    - Java requires type declarations for all variables

6. **Scanner Utility**
    - Used for reading input from the console (`Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);`)

7. **Casting**
    - Widening (e.g., `int` to `double`) is implicit
    - Narrowing (e.g., `double` to `int`) must be explicit: `int b = (int) a;`

8. **Arrays**
    - Java arrays are zero-indexed
    - Declaring an array: `double[] myList = new double[10];` fills with 0.0
    - Accessing an out-of-bounds index throws an exception

9. **String Indexing**
    - Strings are zero-indexed like arrays
    - `charAt(3)` gets the fourth character

10. **Control Structures**
    - `if-else`: `else` executes when the `if` condition is false
    - `switch`: If no case matches, `default` executes
    - `break` exits a `switch` block

11. **Boolean Expressions and Logical Operators**
    - `^` is XOR: true only if operands differ
    - `&&`, `||`, `!` are standard logical operators

12. **Default Values**
    - `int`: 0
    - `double`: 0.0
    - `boolean`: false
    - `char`: null character `\u0000`
    - `String`: null (object reference)

**Tips for Exam Day:**
- Review both quizzes thoroughly
- Practice identifying syntax errors and reading code output
- Understand array indexing and default values
- Get familiar with logical operators and control flow
- Bring a pencil (or use a golf pencil if needed)

**Accommodations:**
- Exams for students with accommodations have been sent to the DRC
- Arrangements must be made with the Disability Resource Center (DRC)

**Youâ€™ve Got This!**
Review the quizzes, sleep well, bring a pencil, and come ready to show what you know. Good luck!
